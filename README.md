# Design-and-Verification-of-SPI-Protocol
The serial peripheral interface (SPI) is a communication interface used to send data between multiple devices. These devices are organized into a master and slave configuration, in which the master has control over the slaves and the slaves receive instruction from the master. It mainly requires three lines between master and slave- Chip Select(CS), Master In Slave Out (MOSI) ans sclk( serial clock). The inputs to Master are-clk, din(12 bits), newd(new data- high when data is to be sent, low otherwise) and reset. The output lines of slave are- dout(12 bits) and done(high when all the bits are collected, low otherwise). MOSI is the pin used to transmit the data serially from master to slave. SCLK is a serial clock used in slave for synchronisation. When the newd=high, transaction between master and slave starts and data is sent serially. When all the bits are sent the done is set as high and transaction stops. In this design, the data is sent one clock cycle after CS signal becomes high. Also, the sclk has time period: T(sclk)=20* T(clk). The test environment is built to check whether the data sent from master(din) is same as the data received in MOSI of slave.

 The waveform obtained shows the signal values at various simulation times. It can be verified that the data sent by din(3a7) is received by slave when CS becomes high again and data from master is collected by temp (slave).
